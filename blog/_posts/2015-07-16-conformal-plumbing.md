The construction used in [Omar Kidwai's talk], in which he describes a family of rational curves
degenerating to a nodal $$\mathbf{P}^1$$ equipped with a family of connections with four poles which 
limits to a meromorphic connection on the nodal curve with three poles on each rational component,
is sometimes referred to as the *conformal plumbing construction* and occurs in this recent Paper by Swoboda:
