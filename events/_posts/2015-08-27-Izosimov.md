It is well-known that the majority of finite-dimensional
integrable systems can be solved by linearizing them on the Jacobian of
the associated spectral curve. In the talk, I will explain how to extend
this technique to study singularities of integrable systems.

Singularities of integrable systems are those points where the first
integrals become dependent. In the first part of the talk, I will discuss
some aspects of the local theory of such singularities and show how to use
generalized Jacobians to prove that singularities corresponding to nodal
spectral curves are non-degenerate.

Then, time permitting, I will discuss the global structure of singular
fibers corresponding to reducible spectral curves. Such fibers turn out to
have interesting combinatorics related to convex polytopes, orientations
of graphs etc. I will also mention the conjectural relation of these
fibers to certain compactifications of generalized Jacobians.
