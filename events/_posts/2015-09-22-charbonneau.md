Abstract: We will explore the differential geometry and the algebraic geometry related to the Bogomolny equation and its solutions, monopoles.  I will give background material on monopoles, and explain how singular monopoles mediate Hecke transformations.  I will describe how singular monopoles on the product of a circle and a Riemann surface correspond to stable algebra-geometric objects on the surface.
