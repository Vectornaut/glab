Abstract: We continue our tour of introductory examples by discussing
double surfaces. After describing the topology of double surfaces, I will
explain how holomorphic 2-forms control the presence of algebraic homology
cycles. I will then discuss about the period map for surfaces, and the
Griffiths transversality relation, which is a Hodge theoretic phenomenon
not appearing in dimension 1.
