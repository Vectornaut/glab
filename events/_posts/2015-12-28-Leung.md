Abstract:The original twistor theory of Penrose gives a correspondence between a
4-dimensional Minskowski space and a complex space. The correspondence
thus relates differential equations to complex geometry. In the talk we
will explore Hitchin's approach - starting with a complex manifold with a
rational curve and find their analytic counterparts. We will be following
Hitchin's \it{Complex Manifolds and Einstein's Equation} (1982).
