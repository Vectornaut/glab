Abstract: Tomorrow, I'll bring you up to speed on an ongoing project I have with
Marco: how certain singular S^1-spaces may help us answer two questions in
mathematics:

1) What is a "section" of a gerbe?
2) How can we realize monopoles in gauge theory as smooth objects rather
than as singular objects?
