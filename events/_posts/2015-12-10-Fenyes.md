Abstract: On Tuesday, we used abelianization to get a look at the distinctive
Poisson geometry of the Teichm√ºller space of a punctured surface. Today,
we'll try to do the same on a compact surface. In this setting, however,
the abelianization machine encounters severe technical difficulties. I'll
get it unstuck using tools from an unexpected source: the dynamical theory
of billiards. Our venture into dynamics will be rewarded with a glimpse of
exotic wall-crossing behavior not seen in the punctured surface case.
