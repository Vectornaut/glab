Abstract: According to to the Weinstein splitting theorem (1983), any Poisson
manifold is locally (near any given point m) a product of a symplectic
manifold with another Poisson manifold whose Poisson bivector field
vanishes at m.

Similar splitting results exist for Lie algebroids, anchored vector
bundles, Dirac structures, generalized complex structures and so on. I
will explain a new approach towards these results, leading to more precise
versions and generalizations.
