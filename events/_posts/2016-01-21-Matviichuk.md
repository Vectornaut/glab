Abstract: In this basic talk, I will try to outline the proof of the Hodge decomposition of the de Rham cohomology of a compact K채hler manifold. I will remind the definition of the K채hler manifold, state K채hler identities (maybe I will say a few words how to get them), derive the equality/proportionality of three relevant Laplacians, and finally will show how to deduce the Hodge decomposition from the latter.
