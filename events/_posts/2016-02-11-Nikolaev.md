Abstract: Given a family of algebraic varieties $$X \rightarrow S$$, a Gauss-Manin connection is a natural 
connection over $$S$$ on the fibrewise de Rham cohomology sheaf $$\mathcal{H}^\bullet$$. An exponential Gauss-Manin 
connection arises similarly when the fibrewise cohomology is twisted by a function $$f : X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1$$. 
The configuration of singularities of $$f$$ determines the correct homology theory $$\mathcal{H}^f_\bullet$$ that pairs 
with the twisted cohomology $$\mathcal{H}^\bullet_f$$; this pairing is the integral representation of solutions to the 
given exponential Gauss-Manin system. We will say that to give a “motivic description” of a given differential system is 
to describe it as an exponential Gauss-Manin connection as above.

In this talk, I will explain the setup for exponential Gauss-Manin connections. Instead of giving a detailed construction, 
I will focus on a few concrete examples. Specifically, I will give the motivic description of the Airy differential equation, 
as well as the example of the simple harmonic oscillator.
