No prior knowledge of stacks will be assumed for this talk. We will discuss the theory of toric stacks, which like toric varieties, is a class of stacks which is particularly amenable to computation. Time provided, we will briefly touch upon the connection to logarithmic geometry as well as Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch for stacks.
