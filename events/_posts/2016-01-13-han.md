Abstract:  In string theory, one ends up looking at enumerative geometry of
counting algebraic (over complex numbers) curves with constraints in
Calabi-Yau varieties. In this talk however, we will start from the most
simplest case of looking at the theory in projective spaces. I will start
with discussion with the brief motivation, then set up Kontsevich moduli
space of stable maps. Then we will explore GW-invariants and quantum
cohomology, then see how these methods from physics give systematic answer
to finding number of plane curves passing through aome number of points.
If time is left, I will explain why situation gets complicated in
Calabi-Yau case.
