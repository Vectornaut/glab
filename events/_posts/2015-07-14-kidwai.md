Spectral networks are certain collections of oriented paths on a Riemann
surface C equipped with some extra data, originating from the study of
counting BPS states in 4d supersymmetric field theories. A mathematical
application of these is to produce a class of Darboux coordinates for
moduli spaces of flat connections on bundles over C. In this talk we
discuss the possibility of using these coordinates for computing the low
energy effective superpotentials for a class of theories associated to
Riemann surfaces. This is accomplished by looking at the subspace of
"opers", a particular type of flat connection which is gauge-equivalent to
an ODE, so the physical problem is mapped to a geometric one. Physics
prerequisites will be kept to a minimum.
