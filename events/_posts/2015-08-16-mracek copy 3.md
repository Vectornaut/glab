We will discuss the topic of perturbative renormalization of quantum field theories using simple toy models to illustrate the concept.  The main questions to answer are, "what is renormalization and why do we do it?" and, "how do we go about renormalizing a QFT?".  Scalar $$\phi^4$$ theory will be the example we use to investigate these questions.  No physics background will be assumed.
