Abstract: The space of hyperbolic structures on a punctured surface, expanded to
include complex projective structures, is a simple example of a Hitchin
integrable system. I'll use it to illustrate some of the intricate Poisson
geometry of Hitchin systems. In particular, we'll see its hyperkähler
structure and wall-crossing phenomena through the windows of Gaiotto,
Hollands, Moore, and Neitzke's abelianization machine. (This talk will
serve as a prequel to Thursday's.)
