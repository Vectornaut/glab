Abstract: Hitchin's equations are a system of gauge theoretic equations on a Riemann
surface that are of interest in many areas including representation theory,
Teichmuller theory, and the geometric Langlands correspondence. In this
talk, I'll describe what solutions of SL(n,C)-Hitchin's equations ``near the
ends'' of the moduli space look like. This construction generalizes
Mazzeo-Swoboda-Weiss-Witt's (2014) construction of SL(2,C)-solutions of
Hitchin's equations where the Higgs field is "simple." This is ongoing work.
