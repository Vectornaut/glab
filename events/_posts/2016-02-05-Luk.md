Abstract:We will start out by defining log Picard algebroids and then discuss the notion of a meromorphic line bundle: 
the geometric pre-quantization of a log Picard algebroid. We will show how all of this is intimately tied to the mixed Hodge 
theory of the quasi-projective complement. Throughout, we will use the example of the complement of the elliptic curve in 
P2 to motivate the theory.
